# Pretrained-image-classifier-to-identify-dog-breeds.

Already developed python classifiers are used to classify images of dogs and identify their breeds.

This project examined which image classification algorithm works the best in classifying images as 
"dogs" or "not dogs"

It also examined how well the best classification algorithm works in correctly identifying a dog's breed.

Lastly, the project timed how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problems.
