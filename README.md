Using a Pretrained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

Already developed python classifiers are used to classify images of dogs and identify their breeds.

This project examined which image classification algorithm works the best on classifying images as 
"dogs" or "not dogs"

It also examined how well the best classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed.

Lastly, the project timed how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problems.
